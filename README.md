Projeto Final

This notebook is applies Natural Language Processing Text Vetorization to a set of restricted corpora: thecnical engineering documents from Petrobras and GloVe, demonstrating different aproachs and applications.

It parses pre-downloaded PDF files,  pre-process and saves the text into CSV files as a checkpoint. 

The text is tokenized and Word2vec and Doc2vec Gensim models are trained.

Principal Component Analysis is applied to word2vec in equivalent text (Petrobras technical documents in Portuguese and English) providing visual cues for the technical documents trained word2vec models both in languages.

Word similarly is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the model in sample words.

Basic operations using Word2Vec are demonstrated both in the Portuguese and in GloVe.

Gensim translation matrix is applied between different corpora.

Doc2Vec similarly function is applied in documents search. 

Translation matrix in-between corpora is demonstrated. 

To Do:

Improve Doc2Vec similarly seach user interface.
